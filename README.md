# Python Student_and_Bank_record_system
Beginner-friendly Python mini projects developed during my internship at YoungDev.
Each project focuses on building strong programming fundamentals — from functions and loops to file handling and OOP concepts.

🚀 Projects Included


📂 File Handling – Student Records

An extended version of the student record system that uses file handling to save data permanently.
It reads and writes records to a text file, ensuring data persistence.

🏦 Bank Management System

A Python program built using Classes and Objects that simulates basic banking operations —
like creating accounts, depositing, withdrawing, and checking balances.

🧠 Concepts Covered

✅ Python Basics (loops, conditions, input/output)
✅ File Handling (read/write files)
✅ Exception Handling
✅ Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects)
✅ Real-world problem-solving

🌟 Learning Outcomes

These projects helped me understand how to:
Store and manage data using files
Build structured programs using OOP
Write clean and reusable Python code
