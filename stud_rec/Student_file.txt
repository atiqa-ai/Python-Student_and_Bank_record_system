# 🎓 Student Record Management System  

A beginner-friendly **Python mini project** that demonstrates how to manage **student records** using **file handling**.  
This project lets users add and view student data (like ID, Name, and Marks) directly from the console — with data stored safely in a text file for future use.  

## ✨ Features  
- ➕ **Add new student records** (ID, Name, Marks)  
- 📖 **View all existing student records**  
- 💾 **Persistent storage** using a `.txt` file  
- ⚙️ **Input validation** for numeric marks (int or float)  
- 🧠 Beginner-level example of **file handling** and **basic loops** in Python  

## 🧩 Concepts Used  
- File handling (`open`, `read`, `write`)  
- Exception handling (`try-except`)  
- Loops & conditionals  
- User input and simple text file storage  

📘 *A simple yet practical program to understand file-based data storage in Python!*
